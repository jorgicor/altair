POKES
=====

When you assemble the game, the assembler will print this two lines:

~~~
Invincible: 32985
Pass level: 32986
~~~

The numbers are an example and can vary.

Setting the `Invincible` address to `1` will make you immune to shots.
Setting address `Pass level` to `1` will allow you to use the key `D` to pass
the current level.

Enjoy
