mmelody mode asmfile

	'mode' is 'zx' or 'cpc'.

	Takes 'asmfile' and takes all the notes it can find. Notes any text
that starts with a note name (ABCDEFG), an optional 'S' character for
one semitone up, and a octave number. Then the program finds the highest
and lowest pitch. Then, outputs to console the same asmfile, but all the
notes are changed to a lower pitch or higher pitch if the highest pitch
is too high or the lowest pitch is too low for the architecture. That is
all the song pitch is raised or lowered.
