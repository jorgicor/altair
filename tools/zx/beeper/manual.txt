Calculates the periods for the ZX Spectrum beeper routine.
The formula is 437500 / note_freq - 29.5 (the ROM BEEP routine uses
437500 / note_freq - 30.125).

Each note in the western 12 equal temperament is at a factor of 2^(1/12)
from the previous. A4 is 440Hz. The frequency one octave note is exactly
the double of the previous octave note frequency.
