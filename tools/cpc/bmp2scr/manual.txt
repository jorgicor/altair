bmp2scr mode bitmap output_scr output_pal

	Given a .bmp file generates two binary files, 'output_scr' and
'output_pal'.  'output_scr' will be a binary file that can be loaded
directly to the cpc video memory (thus it will have a size of 16k).
'output_pal' will be a binary file with 16 bytes, each byte being the
firmware (basic) color to use for each INK.

'mode' can be:
	cpc16x2		Amstrad CPC 16 colors doubled

		This mode means that the original bitmap should have a width
of 320 pixels. Only pixels on an even x coordinate are taken, and each 2
pixels taken will form a byte in the final screen file. The height of the
bitmap must be at least 200 pixels. The bitmap must have palette.
