bmp2asm mode assembler spec bitmap [output_file_name]

	This programs is used to extract pixel data from a .bmp file 'bitmap'
in assemler format. It uses a text based 'spec' file that specifies how to
extract the data. The bitmap must have palette. 'assembler' specifies for
which assembler are we generating the data. If 'ouput_file_name' is not
specified, data is generated on the standard output (console).

'mode' can be:

	cpc16x2		Amstrad CPC 16 colors doubled

		This mode means that the in the original bitmap each 2 pixels
	forms a pixel on the amstrad, thus we only take the even horizontal
	pixels from the bitmap (odd horizontal pixels are ignored). Then the
	pixels are extracted to form pixel data for an Amstrad CPC in mode 0
	(16 colors per pixel).

'assembler' can be:

	tasm		Telemark Cross Assembler

The 'spec' file is a text file and each line is a command that instructs what
to extract. These are the commands allowed:

	0 name x y w h
		Extracts an sprite with label 'name'. We will extract the
		pixels from the bitmap starting at x,y coordinates and with
		dimensions w,h (width, height). The output format depends on
		'mode'.
	1 name x y color
		Extracts a font character with a label 'name' from the pixel
		coordinates x,y. A font character is 8x8 pixels. Color is a
		palette index in the original bitmap. We only extract pixels
		with that color, the rest are considered transparent. The
		output format depends on 'mode'.
	2 name
		The palette is extracted with label 'name'. How many colors are
		extracted depends on 'mode'. The colors are in hardware units
		and with 64 added. For example, 20 is black in hardware units
		(in firmware units it is 0), so we extract 84 for that color.
