	* Fixed: for the CPC, after some time, the alien ships remained on the
	right middle of the screen. This happened because we overwrote the
	seed used for 'rand' when we drew the starfield, and because of that
	the seed always started for the rest of the game (aliens moves, etc)
	at the same start value.  Now, we save the random seed when we draw
	the starfield, so we can restore it later and then it truly cycles for
	the rest of the game. Changed as well for the ZX.

	* We were autodetecting the AY chip for the ZX Spectrum, but some
	emulators have problems with this. Now, we create two different tapes
	for the ZX, one with AY sound (128K) and one with beeper sound (48K).

	* Removed copyright years from most headers.

	* Fixed tools/cpc/bmp/bmp_load.c to make it work on 64-bit systems
	(changed longs for ints).
