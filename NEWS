* Fixed: for the CPC, after some time, the alien ships remained on the right
  middle of the screen. This happened because we overwrote the seed used
  for 'rand' when we drew the starfield, and because of that the seed always
  started for the rest of the game (aliens moves, etc) at the same start value.
  Now, we save the random seed when we draw the starfield, so we can restore it
  later and then it truly cycles for the rest of the game. Changed as well for
  the ZX.

* We were autodetecting the AY chip for the ZX Spectrum, but some emulators
  have problems with this. Now, we create two different tapes for the ZX,
  one with AY sound (128K) and one with beeper sound (48K).
